## Core Concepts Explained

### What Defines an Altcoin Season?

An altcoin season occurs when **75% or more** of the top 100 cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Conversely, a Bitcoin season is characterized by BTC outperforming **75% or more** of the altcoin market. This binary classification helps investors gauge market sentiment:

| Season Type | Performance Threshold | Market Implication |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Altcoin Season | â‰¥75% altcoins > BTC | Market diversification |
| Bitcoin Season | â‰¥75% BTC > altcoins | Risk-off sentiment |

### Methodology Behind the Index

The ASI calculation follows these parameters:
1. Excludes stablecoins (e.g., USDT, DAI) and asset-backed tokens (e.g., WBTC, stETH)
2. Considers top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization
3. Measures 90-day rolling price performance
4. Updates daily to reflect real-time market dynamics

## Strategic Applications

### Market Timing and Portfolio Management

The ASI provides actionable insights for:
- **Entry/Exit Timing:** Identifying when altcoins gain momentum
- **Portfolio Rebalancing:** Adjusting BTC/altcoin allocation based on seasonality
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluating market-wide risk appetite

When the index rises above 75, professional traders often increase exposure to promising altcoins. Conversely, a score below 25 may signal a defensive posture favoring Bitcoin.

### Ethereum's Role in the Index

As the first smart contract platform, Ethereum (ETH) holds a unique position. Despite its market dominance, ETH qualifies as an altcoin for ASI calculations. Its dual role as both infrastructure and investment asset makes it a key indicator within the index.

- Historical correlation with altcoin seasonality validates inclusion

## Strategic Considerations

### Portfolio Allocation Framework

A dynamic allocation strategy based on ASI levels:
- **Altcoin Season (75+):** 60-70% altcoins, 20-30% Bitcoin
